# I am Dylan Chung and I am a 3rd year CS major. I have some experience working with Next, React, and some Spring Boot.

I was thinking that our project could be made up of three general parts:

- A page with a calendar to schedule food
- A page to create recipes
- A page to look up other people's recipes

We would have login using Google OAuth.
