# User Journey

As a group manager, I can compile all the google calendars of my group members into one calendar to look for shared open timeslots
As a group manager, I can search for open timeslots using a filter for the minimum duration of these open slots, which can speed up the search when looking for an hour long openings vs openings a few minutes long.

As a manager, I can filter the results for a subset of people, so that I can arrange meetings with specific people and not everyone.
As a user, I can block out certain times manually, so that my manager does not arrange a meeting during my break time.
As a manager, I can see the number of people busy during each hour, so that if it is not possible to meet with everyone, to be able to meet with as many people as possible.
As a user, the app can list out all the free times, so that I do not have to manually look through the calendar for each one.

As a manager, I can select a few “important” people that must be available to attend (or rank importance) and the app automatically proposes time fitting that requirement.
As a user, I can have some privacy by other people only seeing number of people unavailable at certain times rather than the name of those people.

As a manager, I want to take google calender schedule from each team member as input and sort it with modifiable criteria, so that I can prioritize meetings without manually assigning time.
As a team member, I want to be able to interact with other people's schedule easily, so that I can customize meeting schedule without conflict with each other.

As a Manager I want to be able to see the minimum and maximum duration of each member's shift so that I can control the flow of workers throughout the days
As a team member, I want to be able to give my preferred number of hours to work each week so that I can control how many hours I work each week to not get overworked

As a user, I want to be able to suggest different times that work for me and vote for them so that I can resolve time conflicts.
