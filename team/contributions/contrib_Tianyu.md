## Explanation for the contribution graph
The potential fewer number of commits is due to less frequent of PR testing and merging during the quarter(which I usually leave it to members that are more experienced)

It is also due to a shift of gear for my roles to mainly focus on user manual and the presentation for the last two weeks.
