Hey guys I'm Tianyu. I am a third year CS student (just got transfered from EE last quarter) and I would like to have more time to learn from you guys throughout this quarter!
I had project experience of web application and andriod mobile application mostly using Java (Spring, React, andriod...)
I'm not sure if any of you guys did initialize the project idea, so for me right now Im open to any idea with the project
