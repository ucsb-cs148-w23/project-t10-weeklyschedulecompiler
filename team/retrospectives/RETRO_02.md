# Retrospective 2, 2/21/23

* Led by: Cyril Wang
* Present: everyone (Wesley Kam, Tianyu Sun, Maya Ma, Luke Li, Dylan Chung)
* Absent: n/a

## Action item

* a goal: We want to get better on having everybody on the same page, specifically in both our short-term and long-terms plans for the product. 
We feel that although we discuss our plans from time to time, we stil find ourselves with different ideas of how our features and the product will look. In
addition, another thing that we have been struggling with is working with each other's code and trying to understand what it does. We have found that we do not document
our code, so it is hard to tell what our functions are supposed to do and work. Finally, we also have been struggling with motivation after the MVP.

* a change: So, one thing that we want to change to handle the first issue is to use our class time to meet together and discuss our intentions for the product and for
the upcoming week, to take advantage of the times where we are all together in-person. For the second issue, we want to comment our code more to try and document what 
our code is supposed to do, so that other team members have an easier time understanding what is going on when working with the code that we wrote. Plus, we also are 
thinking of writing outlines for our functions before implementing them, so that our code is more structured and thus easier for everyone to follow. For our final issue, we 
were thinking of implementing deadlines ourselves to motivate ourselves to get work done, something like finishing an issue per meeting (issue doesn't have to be very big). 

* a measurement: So for the first goal, one way to measure may be to see if we hold and document more sprint planning or other such meetings.
 If we were to use our class times on meeting together and discussing, rather than working on our code, then it's likely that there would be more meetings documented in the
`team` directory. For the second goal, one way to measure is to see whether the amount of comments used in our code increases. For the third goal, one way to measure is to 
see if more issues are being done between meetings.

## Optional

* Might want to think about refactoring code to increase readibility
* put every issue in the kanban board
* continue standardizing naming conventions, is helpful
* might want to stop with the PR thread, would like to be able to reply to people in threads.


# Retro Assessment

* In this retro, we continued to use the start/stop/continue retro. How we did it was that we first took 5 minutes to brainstorm things that we wanted to start, stop, or 
continue doing, and afterwards, we would discuss which of those we felt was the most important and why they were important. Then, we discussed what we wanted to change or
what we would do in order to carry out those changes. 
* I think that the retro went pretty well, the team had more to share this time around since we had more experience working together. I think that they were a bit reluctant
to share that much and needed some prodding at first, but after that we generated some good ideas and helped each other see things that we wouldn't have been able to see
by ourselves. I think one thing that was good was brainstorming ideas together on how to improve our team, like how we took away from the retro is trying to smooth out 
the work process by telling each other how we implemented or how we want each feature to be like, and were able to think together on how we wanted to fix that.
* Some advice would be to try and remain partial. It was really tempting to share what I thought (and I may have accidentally done so), but what really helped the 
discussion start up was having the other members of the team participate and share their thoughts. Having the leader share their opinion may influence team members into
being afraid of going against their opinion. Another thing is that while you may not be able to fully share your thoughts, it's still helpful to provide questions to 
help them discuss and to help them think.

# Retro Experiment Outcomes

* So one experiment that we wanted to try was to use our lecture time / group meeting times to focus more on planning out the product and discussing the direction our group wanted to take for both the week and the product in general. We didn't really have many opportunities to try this out, as we did the retro on Tuesday and Thursday's lecture didn't leave much time, but the meeting that we had after the retro during Tuesday's lecture was very helpful in helping us get on the same page. Firstly, we were very ambitious and wanted to incorporate a lot of features, but having the meeting helped us re-focus and prioritize certain issues, specifically those suggested in the feedback from the MVPs. So we were able to narrow down to a couple important issues/features/user stories that we really want to focus on and refine. Secondly, spending that time meeting was useful in making sure that everyone
