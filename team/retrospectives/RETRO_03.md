# Retrospective 3, 3/10/2023

* Led by: Dylan Chung
* Present: everyone (Wesley Kam, Tianyu Sun, Maya Ma, Luke Li, Cyril Wang)
* Absent: n/a

## Action item

* a goal: We want to review, approve, and merge PRs more regularly without need for requests for PR approvals
* a change: We are going to start reviewing PRs every class right after scrum meetings
* a measurement: We are going to keep track of how many PRs there are after every class

# Retro Assessment

* In this retro, we continued to use the start/stop/continue retro. How we did it was that we first took 5 minutes to brainstorm things that we wanted to start, stop, or 
continue doing, and afterwards, we would discuss which of those we felt was the most important and why they were important. Then, we discussed what we wanted to change or
what we would do in order to carry out those changes. 
* As we're about one week away from the final code freeze, we only had about two starts, one stop, and a few continues. We discussed briefly about what we should do and ended retro quickly.
* I would recommend that the next retro leader give more time for start, stop, and continue generation, but cut it short if people can't think of anything.
