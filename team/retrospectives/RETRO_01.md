# Date of Retrospective: 01/27/23

* Led by: Wesley Kam
* Present: Everyone present!

## Action item

* a goal: we want to get better at planning and assigning issue to team members. This past sprint was very crazy (probably cuz we were setting everything up), so we wanna minimize the stress for everyone.
* a change: we are going to decide on 1 or 2 user stories (depending on how big) that we want to complete by the end of the week, create issues, and write acceptance criteria more concretely so that everyone knows exactly what needs to be done.
* a measurement: hard to find a numeric measurement, but we can tell if what we are doing is working by seeing if the confusion regarding WHAT to do is minimized and there are more questions on HOW to do things instead. 

## Retro Assessment

* We used the Start, Stop, Continue model where we took some time to answer the 3 prompts, voted on which ones we wanted to talk about, and then discussed the issues that received the most votes.
* Our retro went well with lots of dicussions regarding many things we wanted to start. A lot of the issues that gave our team members lots of the stress over the week were addressed so hopefully this next week will go more smoothly.
* Try to pose more questions rather than giving a lot of takes first. It was very hard to resist giving my perspective on things so I gave in to it many times. Next time, I will allow the team to talk more first before hopping in.
