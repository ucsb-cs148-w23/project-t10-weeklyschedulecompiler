# Date of Retrospective: 01/27/23

* Led by: Wesley Kam
* Present: Everyone present!

## Action item

* a goal: we want to get better at planning and assigning issue to team members. This past sprint was very crazy (probably cuz we were setting everything up), so we wanna minimize the stress for everyone.
* a change: we are going to decide on 1 or 2 user stories (depending on how big) that we want to complete by the end of the week, create issues, and write acceptance criteria more concretely so that everyone knows exactly what needs to be done.
* a measurement: hard to find a numeric measurement, but we can tell if what we are doing is working by seeing if the confusion regarding WHAT to do is minimized and there are more questions on HOW to do things instead. 

## Retro Assessment

* We used the Start, Stop, Continue model where we took some time to answer the 3 prompts, voted on which ones we wanted to talk about, and then discussed the issues that received the most votes.
* Our retro went well with lots of dicussions regarding many things we wanted to start. A lot of the issues that gave our team members lots of the stress over the week were addressed so hopefully this next week will go more smoothly.
* Try to pose more questions rather than giving a lot of takes first. It was very hard to resist giving my perspective on things so I gave in to it many times. Next time, I will allow the team to talk more first before hopping in.

## Retro Experiment Outcomes
One experiment that we tried doing was to try to streamline the process of making PR's and informing the team about it. In this, we wanted to post a link to the PR in the slack everytime we made a PR, but felt that doing so would clutter the chat and make it hard for people to see important messages that people send. 2 proposals were made for this. One was to utilize the `@here` functionality to send notifications to everyone when something important needs to be addressed. Second was to create a PR thread in the slack and only use that for posting PR review requests. So far, we haven't used the first one much, but we have utilized the 2nd one well, in that everyone posts their PR's in their and we still receive notifications for them. I think that it has been useful in keeping the important content in the slack easier to see, so I think that we will continue this.
