My name is Wesley. I'm a 3rd year computer science major. I have experience with Nodejs and Reactjs mainly from CS156

For this project, I assume that we would use Nodejs and Reactjs since this is what most of us are comfortable with.
Perhaps we will use MondoDB to store user data and create our own restful APIs to store the data.
We can probably bypass having to create our own user database by simply using Google's API to have users login with Google

As for features, one idea I have would be to have users input a meal recipe and then we can multiply the recipe to meal plan for the whole week
