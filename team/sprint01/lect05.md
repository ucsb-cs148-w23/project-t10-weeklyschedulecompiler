*Scribed Discussion*

Dylan finished up drawing the wireframe for detailing the layout of our project and planned out what data types and variables we need for our database. He plans on working on implementing components for the pages we need. No blockers for now.

Wesley created our Heroku app and implemented a navigation bar for our app and made a pull request for that. He will update the `README.md` for lab02. No blockers.

Maya watched tutorials and learned react and express, and started making the login page for our app. She will finish up the login page, and plans on learning more on react and git. No blockers.

Luke worked on the log-in button for our app, and will finish that and make a PR for it. He also plans on writing our `conventions.md` page. No blockers.

Tianyu finished the previous homework and set up our firebase environment. He plans on finishing setting up firebase and learning more about how to use it. No blockers.

Cyril worked on setting up Google OAth and thinking of more issues to work on. He plans on finishing up this issue and to work on creating more page components for the other pages of our app. One blocker is that his current issue overlaps with Luke's, so he may let Luke do his and work on a separate issue.
