In our sprint planning, we decided that for our first sprint, we should focus more on the visual/frontend side of the project, and to set up the app so that it looks visually ready. For instance, some issues that we could work on is to create a login button for people to login with using their google accounts. Also, we plan on creating pages that we can navigate to and components of those pages, just without functionality.
