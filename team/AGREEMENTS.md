1. to try to make all meetings, but to let team members know if you will be absent
2. to check-in with one another, to not just worry about what we're doing
3. to spread the work evenly, to rely on others, to not try to do everything on our own
4. be supportive of one another
5. everyone must come to a consensus about what actions we want to take
6. Make large decisions together with a voting system (maybe something like the person that brings it up sits out and then the other 5 people vote on it)
7. Try to bring up when youâ€™re just too busy to work so we can spread work out evenly among the rest of the team
