# User Feedback Needs

1. Is our UI too simple? Should we have more components or color / are there any improvements to what we have now?
2. For our free time selector, do you think that when we fetch a group's free time, that we should display those free times as events in the calendar?
Or should we just list it out.
3. On a group's page, does it feel too empty? Is there more features that would make it the group page better?
