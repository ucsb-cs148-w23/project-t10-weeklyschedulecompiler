# User Feedback Needs

1. UI look - Is our UI too simple? Should we have more components or color / are there any improvements to what we have now?
2. Putting free time into calendar - For our free time selector, do you think that when we fetch a group's free time, that we should display those free times as events in the calendar? Or does that look too cluttered? How do you think we should display free time? (in calendar, listing it out, etc...)
3. Simplicity - is it easy to understand how the app works? are there any buttons / features that are confusing as to what they do or that didn't do as you expected? 
4. writing events to google calendar - do they want created events in the app to also be added to their google calendar? 
5. performance - do events show up in calendar after refreshing / creating event? or does it take a lot of refreshes?
6. navigation - is the navigation intuitive? also how is the design of the navbar, should we make it look nicer / standout more?
