Create an issue related to the feature you are working on

- Be sure to create a checklist in the issue description for what the  
   feature will accomplish in the end

Pull the latest changes from the main branch and create a feature branch to start working on

- Naming Convention: Your Initials followed by the title of the branch
  (i.e. LLTestingBranch)

Once you've finished working on the feature branch, run a git rebase to update your feature branch and create a PR for your feature branch

Post a link to the PR in the team slack channel for others to review and eventually merge
