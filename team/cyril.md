Hi, my name is Cyril and I am a 3rd year CS major. Most of my experience with framework is stuff from CS156, so mainly node, react, etc... In my free time I like to play sports (mainly basketball), read, and play video games (very unique).

I think we're fine with sticking to the basis of having this be a web app that people can store their recipes. One idea that I had to add on to this was to add stuff like being able to rank/rate recipes or label recipes. Another idea that I really want to do is do something like being able to filter recipes by ingredients, so like if you have something that you need to use up, you can access all the recipes that you can use. Other stuff include social aspects, like sharing your recipes with friends, but we don't have to use all these ideas. Finally, we could also make this like a planner, so you can plan out your meals for the week as well so that you can minimize time thinking about that during the week.
