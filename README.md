# Description 

Our app aims to provide useful tools for groups to compile their schedules and work around them. A few tools that we are going for are giving the groups the ability to find times where everyone is available or create a part-time schedule that takes into account everyone's availabilities. Users will be greeted with our home page where they will be able to log in using Google. They will then be directed to their "Profile" where they will be able to view the scheduling groups that they are in, select a group that they want to view, or create a new group entirely. When viewing a group they will be able to see the compiled schedules of all members in the group and perform actions using the tools mentioned previously.

# User Roles

Our app will have 2 roles, Group Leaders and Group Members. In some cases, such as in a work environment, there will be a need for group leader who has special admin priviledges like adding new members or using the tools. Everyone else in the group will simply be a member who can view the schedule.
